These are some small programs that I have written as a part of learning the basics of Python. 
Following are the information about the programs: 
1. geometrics: a program which prints geometric sequences on the basis of the inputted values of ratio and starting term
2. hangman_final: a program which allows one to play hangman
3. leetcode: some rough work for some of the python leetcode problems 
4. numsinbetween: asks for two inputs and prints all the numbers between those two 
5. python: some test code for learning the basics.
6. romannumeral: takes input of an integer value and returns its roman numeral conversion as a string
